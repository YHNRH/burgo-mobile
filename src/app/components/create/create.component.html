<!--
The template defines the view of the component - what is actually rendered.
In NativeScript applications the template is defined with XML using NativeScript UI elements.
It is different from HTML. So instead of <input>, <span>, <div> etc. - we have <TextField>, <Label> and layouts.
The important thing is that although the elements are different - all of the Angularâ€™s template syntax works exactly the same.
So you can still use template expressions, bindings, templates as well as all the built-in directives.

The ActionBar is the NativeScript common abstraction over the Android ActionBar and iOS NavigationBar.
